# Daily Log - 2025-08-10

## Today I Learned
- **GitHub Connection**: Successfully connected local repository to GitHub
- **Remote Management**: Fixed remote naming (windsurf-learning-journey → origin)
- **Professional Repository**: Published complete learning system to GitHub
- **SSDLC Framework**: Built comprehensive security development lifecycle knowledge base
- **Feature Scoping**: Learned how to define feature boundaries in microservices architecture

## Major Accomplishments
- ✅ **Week 2 Day 8-9 Complete**: Git reference guide + GitHub integration
- ✅ **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Added Git workflows, SSDLC templates, threat modeling
- ✅ **Project Cleanup**: Streamlined repository structure for professional presentation
- ✅ **GitHub Repository Live**: https://github.com/LandonMMoore/windsurf-learning-journey.git

## Key Insights
- **Windsurf Integration**: Don't need to memorize Git commands - Windsurf handles the complexity
- **Security Framework**: SSDLC can be overwhelming, but having reference templates makes it manageable
- **Feature Definition**: Clear boundaries are crucial in microservices - scope determines documentation effort
- **Learning Momentum**: Building comprehensive knowledge base pays dividends for future reference

## Technical Skills Gained
- **Git Remote Management**: Connecting local repositories to GitHub
- **Repository Publishing**: Making learning journey publicly accessible
- **Security Documentation**: Understanding SSDLC phases and responsibilities
- **Microservices Scoping**: Defining feature boundaries and PRD scope

## Commands/Processes Learned
- `git remote -v` - Check remote connections
- `git remote rename [old] [new]` - Fix remote naming
- `git push -u origin main` - Push and set upstream tracking
- Windsurf Source Control panel for GitHub integration

## Next Goals
- **Week 2 Day 10-11**: GitHub collaboration workflows (branches, pull requests)
- **Advanced Windsurf**: Explore more GitHub integration features
- **ClickUp Integration**: Start planning connection between ClickUp and GitHub workflows

## Reflection
**Biggest Win**: Successfully published professional learning repository to GitHub - now have public technical PM presence!

**Confidence Level**: 9/10 - Major milestone achieved connecting to GitHub

**Learning Style Confirmation**: Practical, hands-on approach with reference materials works best

**Strategic Progress**: From local Git user to GitHub-connected Technical PM in one day
