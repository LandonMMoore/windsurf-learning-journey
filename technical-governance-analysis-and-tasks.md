## Phase 6: Strategic Recommendations

### **Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)**
1. **Critical Security Fix**: Address RBAC vulnerability immediately
2. **Team Coordination**: Establish private communication channel
3. **Client Deliverables**: Focus on August deadline penetration testing

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Parallel Development**: Run security fixes parallel to new feature development
2. **Phased Rollout**: Implement changes incrementally to minimize disruption
3. **Backup Plans**: Maintain current systems during transition periods

### **Resource Allocation Considerations**
1. **Security Focus**: Allocate 40% of development resources to security initiatives
2. **Documentation**: Dedicate specific resources to compliance documentation
3. **Training**: Budget time for team upskilling on new processes

### **Success Metrics and Milestones**
1. **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities by September 30
2. **Automation**: 50+ manual processes automated by year-end
3. **Compliance**: Full Accenture technical approval by October 1
4. **Efficiency**: Reduce deployment time by 75% through automation

---

**Total Tasks Identified**: 84 actionable items across Planning (23), Implementation (31), Review (18), and Communication (12) categories.

**Critical Path**: RBAC Security Fix → Multi-IDP Integration → License Management → Client Deliverables → Accenture Review
