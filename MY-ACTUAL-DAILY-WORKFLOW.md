# My Actual Daily Workflow

*Created: July 28, 2025*  
*Purpose: Document current reality of daily workflow, tools, and pain points*

---

## üåÖ MORNING SCAN (Current Reality)

### Daily Startup Routine
- **Check emails** for priority items and urgent decisions
- **Check ClickUp messages** for team updates and task notifications
- **Check Teams/texts** for stakeholder communications and quick decisions
- **Review Apple Notes** for today's personal task list and priorities
- **Prep for team leader meeting** - gather updates and blockers

### Time Investment
- **Total morning scan time:** ~20-30 minutes
- **Most time-consuming:** Switching between multiple communication channels
- **Biggest bottleneck:** Finding scattered decisions and context

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS I'M JUGGLING

### Primary Work Hub
**ClickUp**
- Main work hub for tasks, docs, and PRDs
- Team collaboration and project tracking
- Document storage (though version control is challenging)
- Status updates and progress tracking

### Personal Organization
**Apple Notes**
- Personal daily planning and task management
- Quick capture of ideas and meeting notes
- Private workspace for organizing thoughts
- Bridge between personal and work priorities

### Communication Channels
**Email/Teams/Text**
- Stakeholder decisions scattered across these channels
- Different stakeholders prefer different channels
- Context switching between platforms constantly
- Decision trails hard to follow

### Underutilized Tools
**GitHub**
- Not using yet but want to integrate
- Potential for better version control of PRDs
- Could improve documentation workflow
- Team collaboration opportunity

## üò§ PAIN POINTS

### 1. Scattered Decision Making
- **Problem:** Decisions scattered across email, Teams, texts, and ClickUp
- **Impact:** Hard to track decision history and context
- **Frequency:** Daily frustration, multiple times per day

### 2. No Unified Daily Status
- **Problem:** No single place to see complete daily status
- **Impact:** Inefficient morning routine, missed priorities
- **Current Workaround:** Manual aggregation across multiple tools

### 3. Dashboard Ineffectiveness
- **Problem:** Dashboards exist but aren't helpful for daily workflow
- **Impact:** Still need to dig into individual tools for real information
- **Root Cause:** Dashboards show metrics, not actionable daily context

### 4. PRD Version Control Issues
- **Problem:** PRDs stored in ClickUp are hard to version control
- **Impact:** Difficult to track changes, collaborate on iterations
- **Desired State:** Git-based workflow for documentation

---

## üéØ WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Centralize morning scan** - Create single dashboard or checklist
2. **Standardize decision capture** - Define where decisions get recorded
3. **Streamline communication channels** - Reduce platform switching

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Integrate GitHub workflow** - Move PRDs to version-controlled system
2. **Create unified status system** - Single source of truth for daily priorities
3. **Improve dashboard relevance** - Focus on actionable daily information

### Long-term Vision
1. **Automated status aggregation** - Tools talk to each other
2. **Context-aware notifications** - Right information at right time
3. **Seamless tool integration** - Minimal context switching

---

## üìä Current Tool Usage Patterns

### Daily Usage Frequency
- **ClickUp:** 10-15 times per day
- **Apple Notes:** 5-8 times per day
- **Email:** 8-12 times per day
- **Teams/Text:** 15-20 times per day
- **GitHub:** 0 times per day (but want to change this)

### Context Switching Cost
- **Average switches per day:** ~40-50 between tools
- **Time lost to context switching:** ~30-45 minutes daily
- **Mental overhead:** High - constantly remembering which tool has what info

---

## üöÄ Ideal Future State

### Morning Routine (Vision)
1. **Single dashboard check** - All priority items in one place
2. **Unified notification system** - Important updates aggregated
3. **Context-aware task list** - Today's priorities with full context
4. **Streamlined meeting prep** - Auto-generated status updates

### Tool Integration (Vision)
- **ClickUp ‚Üî GitHub:** PRDs version controlled, tasks linked to commits
- **Apple Notes ‚Üî ClickUp:** Personal planning synced with work priorities
- **Communication channels ‚Üí Central log:** Decisions automatically captured
- **All tools ‚Üí Daily dashboard:** Unified view of what matters today
