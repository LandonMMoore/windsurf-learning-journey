# Technical Governance - ClickUp Hierarchical Structure

## ClickUp Import Strategy

**Import Order:**
1. Import Parent Tasks first
2. Import Subtasks with Parent Task references
3. Set up Milestones as separate items
4. Configure dependencies after import

3. Dependencies will create automatic task relationships

### **Step 4: Configure Views**
- **Timeline View**: Shows all tasks against milestone deadlines
- **Board View**: Organize by Parent Task categories
- **Gantt View**: Shows dependencies and critical path
- **Calendar View**: Monthly delivery schedule

### **Key Benefits of This Structure:**
✅ **Hierarchical Organization**: 8 parent tasks instead of 84 flat tasks
✅ **Clear Milestones**: 4 major delivery dates aligned with roadmap
✅ **Specific Assignees**: Real people from the meeting transcript
✅ **Logical Dependencies**: Tasks build on each other properly
✅ **ClickUp Optimized**: Uses Parent Task relationships and proper formatting

This structure will give you much better project visibility and management capability in ClickUp!
