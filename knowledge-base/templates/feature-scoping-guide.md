# Feature Scoping & PRD Boundaries in Microservices Architecture

*Defining feature scope, PRD boundaries, and security documentation in distributed systems*

## What Constitutes a "Feature"?

### Feature Definition Framework

**A feature is a discrete unit of functionality that:**
- Delivers specific user value
- Can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Fits within a single development sprint/iteration
- Has identifiable security boundaries

### Feature Granularity Levels

#### ðŸ”¹ **Micro-Feature** (1-3 days development)
- Single API endpoint
- UI component enhancement
- Configuration change
- Bug fix with security implications

**Example:** "Add password strength indicator to login form"

#### ðŸ”¸ **Standard Feature** (1-2 weeks development)
- Complete user workflow
- New API with multiple endpoints
- New UI screen/page
- Integration with external service

**Example:** "User profile management system"

#### ðŸ”¶ **Epic Feature** (1-2 months development)
- Multiple related workflows
- Cross-service functionality
- Major architectural changes
- New microservice creation

**Example:** "Multi-tenant authentication system"

## PRD Scope Guidelines

### Single Feature PRD
**Use when:**
- Feature is self-contained within one microservice
- Limited external dependencies
- Clear, bounded functionality
- Standard development timeline (1-2 weeks)

**Structure:**
```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]
## Service: [Microservice Name]
## Dependencies: [List other services]
## Security Scope: [This service + direct integrations]
```

### Multi-Feature PRD
**Use when:**
- Features are tightly coupled
- Shared data models or workflows
- Coordinated release required
- Epic-level functionality

**Structure:**
```markdown
# PRD: [Epic Name]
## Features Included:
- Feature 1 (Service A)
- Feature 2 (Service B)
- Feature 3 (Service A + B integration)
## Cross-Service Dependencies: [Detailed mapping]
## Security Scope: [All involved services + integrations]
```

### Service-Level PRD
**Use when:**
- Creating new microservice
- Major service refactoring
- Service-wide security updates
- Architectural changes

**Structure:**
```markdown
# PRD: [Service Name] v2.0
## Service Scope: [Complete service boundary]
## Features Included: [All features in this release]
## Security Scope: [Entire service + all integrations]
```

## Security Documentation Scope

### Feature-Level Security Scope

#### **Minimal Scope** (Micro-Features)
Include in threat model:
- The specific feature functionality
- Direct data inputs/outputs
- Immediate service boundaries
- Authentication/authorization for this feature

**Example:** For "Add password reset endpoint"
- Include: Password reset flow, token generation, email service integration
- Exclude: Entire user management system architecture

#### **Standard Scope** (Standard Features)
Include in threat model:
- Complete feature workflow
- All service interactions
- Data flow through involved services
- Shared components used

**Example:** For "User profile management"
- Include: Profile service, user service, file storage, API gateway
- Exclude: Unrelated services like billing or notifications

#### **Extended Scope** (Epic Features)
Include in threat model:
- All involved microservices
- Cross-service data flows
- Shared infrastructure components
- External system integrations

**Example:** For "Multi-tenant authentication"
- Include: Auth service, user service, tenant service, API gateway, load balancer
- May exclude: Application-specific services that only consume auth

### Architecture Documentation Rules

#### **Always Include:**
- **Service boundaries** - What's in scope vs. out of scope
- **Data flow** - How data moves between services
- **Trust boundaries** - Where security controls exist
- **External dependencies** - Third-party services and APIs
- **Shared components** - Databases, message queues, caches

#### **Include When Relevant:**
- **Upstream services** - Services that call this feature
- **Downstream services** - Services this feature calls
- **Infrastructure** - Load balancers, API gateways, service mesh
- **Cross-cutting concerns** - Logging, monitoring, configuration

#### **Exclude Unless Directly Related:**
- **Unrelated microservices** - Services with no data/control flow
- **Implementation details** - Internal service architecture
- **Historical context** - Previous versions unless relevant to security

## Practical Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Feature Boundaries
```markdown
**Feature:** [Name]
**Primary Service:** [Which microservice owns this]
**Data Touched:** [What data is created/modified/accessed]
**User Journey:** [Start to finish user interaction]
**External Touchpoints:** [Other services, APIs, UIs involved]
```

### Step 2: Determine PRD Scope
```markdown
**Scope Decision Matrix:**

| Criteria | Single Feature PRD | Multi-Feature PRD | Service PRD |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Services Involved | 1 | 2-3 | 1 (major changes) |
| Development Time | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 months | 2+ months |
| Dependencies | Minimal | Moderate | Extensive |
| Release Coordination | Independent | Coordinated | Service-wide |
```

### Step 3: Define Security Scope
```markdown
**Security Scope Checklist:**
- [ ] Primary service architecture
- [ ] Direct service dependencies
- [ ] Data flow paths
- [ ] Authentication/authorization points
- [ ] External integrations
- [ ] Shared infrastructure (if security-relevant)
```

## Examples by Architecture Pattern

### API Gateway Pattern
**Feature:** "Add rate limiting to user API"
**PRD Scope:** Single feature (rate limiting functionality)
**Security Scope:** 
- API Gateway configuration
- User service (rate limit impact)
- Authentication service (user identification)
- Monitoring service (rate limit metrics)

### Event-Driven Pattern
**Feature:** "User registration triggers welcome email"
**PRD Scope:** Single feature (registration flow)
**Security Scope:**
- User service (registration endpoint)
- Event bus (message security)
- Email service (PII handling)
- User data store (data protection)

### Service Mesh Pattern
**Feature:** "Add service-to-service encryption"
**PRD Scope:** Service-level PRD (affects all services)
**Security Scope:**
- All microservices in mesh
- Service mesh control plane
- Certificate management
- Network policies

## Documentation Templates

### Feature Boundary Template
```markdown
## Feature Boundary Definition
**Feature Name:** [Name]
**Owning Service:** [Primary microservice]
**Involved Services:** [List with interaction type]
**Data Boundaries:** [What data crosses service boundaries]
**Security Perimeter:** [Where security controls apply]
**Out of Scope:** [What's explicitly excluded]
```

### Cross-Service Dependency Map
```markdown
## Service Dependency Map
**Primary Service:** [Name]
**Upstream Dependencies:** [Services this depends on]
**Downstream Consumers:** [Services that depend on this]
**Data Flow:** [How data moves between services]
**Security Handoffs:** [Where security responsibility transfers]
```

## Best Practices

### Feature Scoping
1. **Start small** - Prefer smaller, independent features
2. **Clear boundaries** - Explicit in/out of scope
3. **User value focus** - Each feature delivers user value
4. **Independent deployment** - Features can be released separately

### PRD Scoping
1. **Logical grouping** - Group related features thoughtfully
2. **Release alignment** - Match PRD scope to release scope
3. **Dependency management** - Clearly document cross-service dependencies
4. **Security consistency** - Consistent security approach across PRD scope

### Security Documentation
1. **Proportional effort** - Security documentation matches feature complexity
2. **Reuse architecture** - Reference existing service documentation
3. **Focus on changes** - Emphasize what's new or different
4. **Clear boundaries** - Explicit about what's included in security analysis
