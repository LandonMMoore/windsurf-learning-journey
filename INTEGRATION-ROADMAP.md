# Integration Roadmap - Workflow Optimization

*Created: July 28, 2025*  
*Purpose: Progressive integration plan to optimize daily workflow and reduce tool switching*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This roadmap outlines a 4-level progressive approach to integrate tools and optimize the daily workflow identified in `MY-ACTUAL-DAILY-WORKFLOW.md`. Each level builds on the previous one, reducing context switching and manual overhead.

**Current State:** 40-50 daily context switches, 30-45 minutes lost to tool switching  
**Goal:** Unified workflow with minimal context switching and automated status updates

---

## ðŸ“‹ LEVEL 1 - MANUAL AGGREGATION (Start Here - Week 1-2)

### Objective
Create centralized documentation workflow using existing tools with minimal setup.

### Implementation Steps

**Morning Routine Optimization:**
- **Copy key items** from ClickUp/email into `daily-context.md`
- **Create decision-capture.md** for scattered decisions from all channels
- **Consolidate priorities** from Apple Notes into daily context
- **Prep meeting updates** from single source of truth

**End-of-Day Process:**
- **5-minute status update** in one centralized location
- **Document decisions made** throughout the day
- **Note blockers and next-day priorities**
- **Archive completed items**

**Tools Required:**
- **Windsurf** + copy/paste operations
- **No additional integrations needed**

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Morning scan reduced from 20-30 minutes to 15-20 minutes
- [ ] All decisions captured in single location
- [ ] Daily status available in one place
- [ ] Context switches reduced by 20%

### Files to Create
- `daily-context.md` - Daily aggregated information
- `decision-capture.md` - Centralized decision log
- `daily-status-template.md` - Standardized status format

- **Version control documentation** with ClickUp task references
- **Automated cross-platform updates** for document changes

**Communication Streamlining:**
- **Unified notification system** for all platforms
- **Single interface** for stakeholder updates
- **Automated decision distribution** to relevant channels

**Tools Required:**
- **Windsurf** + MCP (ClickUp + GitHub + Teams connectors)
- **GitHub repository** for document version control
- **Teams integration** for communication

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Single interface for all status updates
- [ ] PRDs version-controlled with ClickUp integration
- [ ] Stakeholder communications automated
- [ ] Context switches reduced by 60%

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] GitHub repository setup for PRDs
- [ ] Teams MCP connector configuration
- [ ] Bi-directional ClickUp integration
- [ ] Cross-platform update workflows
