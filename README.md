# My Windsurf Learning Journey - From PM to Technical PM

> Transforming from traditional Product Manager to Technical PM through hands-on learning with Windsurf, Git, and automation tools.

## Overview

This repository documents my journey learning technical skills to become a more effective Technical Product Manager. Starting from basic Windsurf usage, I'm building toward automated workflows that integrate ClickUp, GitHub, and daily PM tasks.

**Background**: Experienced PM looking to reduce context switching from 40+ daily tool switches to <10 through intelligent automation and better technical workflows.

- **Markdown Mastery**: Created professional documentation and templates
- **Version Control**: Set up Git, learned commit workflows, handled advanced scenarios
- **Visual Creation**: Built HTML pages through AI conversation
- **Project Organization**: Established comprehensive learning system

### 🔄 **Week 2: Knowledge Systems** (IN PROGRESS)
- **Knowledge Base Building**: Reference documentation and quick-lookup guides
- **Personal Wiki System**: Structured information architecture
- **GitHub Integration**: Remote repository management and collaboration
- **Documentation Workflows**: Professional README creation and maintenance

### 📋 **Week 3: MCP Integration** (PLANNED)
- **Model Context Protocol**: Understanding and implementation basics
- **ClickUp Read Integration**: Automated task and project data retrieval
