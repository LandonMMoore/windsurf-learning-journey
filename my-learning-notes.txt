Day 1: Learning Windsurf!

My Day 1 Achievements:

âœ… Installed and opened Windsurf
âœ… Created multiple files with Cascade
âœ… Navigated the three-panel interface
âœ… Edited and saved files
âœ… Discovered smart autocomplete
âœ… Even found the planning mode feature!

Day 2 Achievements:
âœ… Created daily standup template with Cascade
âœ… Learned to modify files through conversation
âœ… Explored project organization and context management
âœ… Mapped out my actual workflow (ClickUp â†’ Windsurf â†’ everywhere)
âœ… Created integration roadmap for MCP agents
âœ… Built daily workflow templates that match my real PM work

Current Initiative:
Building a sustainable PM workspace that:
1. Aggregates scattered decisions from multiple channels
2. Creates a single daily workflow starting point
3. Gradually integrates with ClickUp (read â†’ write â†’ automate)
4. Maintains PRDs with proper version control
5. Eventually syncs status across Teams, ClickUp, and LinkedIn

The Plan:
Week 1-2: Manual daily workflow (copy/paste but organized)
Week 3: MCP integration to READ from ClickUp
Week 4: WRITE capabilities to update multiple platforms
Month 2: Intelligent automation and agent workflows

Key Concepts Learned

Three Panels: Left (file explorer), Middle (editor), Right (Cascade AI chat)

File Types: .txt (plain text), .md (markdown), .py (Python)

Markdown: Simple text formatting that becomes professional documents

Preview Mode: See formatted version of markdown files

Tab: Accept Windsurf's auto-complete suggestions

Important Notes

Files must be saved to appear in the left panel

The â€¢ dot in tabs means "unsaved changes"

Click file tabs to switch between open files

Cascade can create, edit, and update files through conversation

Preview and editor can be viewed side-by-side

"Open diff" shows exactly what Cascade changed
