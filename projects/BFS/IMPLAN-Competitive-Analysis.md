## Executive Summary

This analysis examines IMPLAN's economic impact modeling mechanisms to extract applicable methodologies for our Howard County BFS economic forecasting engine. When BFS advises Howard County on budget allocations, we must substantiate recommendations with rigorous economic analysis. By understanding IMPLAN's proven methodologies, we can develop our own economic substantiation framework using historical budget data, current allocations, and economic factors.

**Key Finding:** IMPLAN's Input-Output modeling, multiplier calculations, and Social Accounting Matrix approach provide a proven framework we can adapt for budget impact analysis using Howard County's specific data sources.

## IMPLAN's Core Economic Impact Mechanisms

### 1. Input-Output (I-O) Analysis Framework

**Foundation:** Based on Nobel Prize winner Wassily Leontief's work, I-O analysis maps buy-sell relationships between all industries, households, and government entities in an economy.

**Core Principle:** All economic actors are interconnected through transactions, so any economic activity creates ripple effects throughout the entire economy.

**Mathematical Approach:** Uses annual regional data to create predictive models that estimate how specific economic changes impact the regional economy.

### 2. Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) Model

**Enhanced Framework:** IMPLAN expands traditional I-O analysis to include:
- Industry-to-industry transactions
- Industry-to-institution transactions  
- Institution-to-institution transactions
- Complete monetary market transaction capture

**Key Advantage:** Provides more comprehensive economic impact analysis than basic I-O models by including household and government spending patterns.

### 3. IMPLAN's Data Sources & Construction Methodology

**Primary Data Sources:**
- Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Benchmark I-O Tables (every 5 years)
- 120+ federal data sources for comprehensive economic coverage
- County, state, and national level data integration
- Trade flow data using calibrated gravity models

**Data Processing Approach:**
1. **Estimation of Non-Disclosed Data** - Fills gaps in public datasets
2. **Geographic Disaggregation** - Breaks national data down to county/zip level
3. **Industry Detail Enhancement** - Provides finer industry categorization
4. **Temporal Projection** - Projects lagged data to current periods
5. **Data Balancing** - Controls estimates against known totals for accuracy

**Annual Update Cycle:** New datasets released annually with ~1 year lag due to federal data availability timelines.

## IMPLAN's Economic Impact Calculation Mechanisms

### 1. Four Key Economic Indicators

**Output (Revenue/Sales):**
- Base multiplier from which all others derive
- Value of production by industry + net inventory change
- Formula: Output = Employee Compensation + Proprietor Income + Tax on Production/Imports + Other Property Income + Intermediate Inputs

**Value Added (GDP Contribution):**
- Difference between Output and cost of Intermediate Inputs
- Measures contribution to GDP by industry
- Encompasses Labor Income, Proprietor Income, Employee Compensation, Other Property Income, Taxes

**Labor Income:**
- Sum of Employee Compensation + Proprietor Income
- Total payroll + self-employed/unincorporated business payments

**Employment:**
- Full-time/part-time annual average jobs
- 1 job lasting 12 months = 2 jobs lasting 6 months = 3 jobs lasting 4 months

### 2. Three-Effect Economic Impact Model

**Direct Effect:**
- Initial exogenous change in final demand
- The primary economic activity being analyzed
- Foundation for calculating multiplier effects

**Indirect Effect:**
- Business-to-business purchases in supply chain
- Secondary economic activity from initial industry spending
- Captures supplier relationships and procurement impacts

**Induced Effect:**
- Household spending from labor income earned in direct/indirect activities
- Tertiary economic activity from worker spending
- Includes spending on goods, services, housing by employees

### 3. Multiplier Calculation Methods

**Type I Multipliers (Business-to-Business Only):**
- Formula: (Direct + Indirect Effects) / Direct Effect
- Focuses only on supply chain impacts
- Excludes household spending effects

**Type SAM Multipliers (Complete Impact):**
- Formula: (Direct + Indirect + Induced Effects) / Direct Effect
- Includes household and institutional spending
- More comprehensive and commonly used approach

**Example:** If Output Multiplier = 2.25, then every $1 of direct production generates $2.25 total economic activity ($1 direct + $1.25 additional)

## IMPLAN Model Assumptions & Limitations

### Core I-O Analysis Assumptions

**1. Constant Returns to Scale**
- Same input quantity needed per unit output regardless of production level
- 10% output increase = 10% input requirement increase

**2. No Supply Constraints**
- Assumes unlimited raw materials and employment availability
- Users must assess reasonableness for large-scale impacts

**3. Fixed Input Structure**
- No input substitution in response to output changes
- Industry maintains same commodity/service mix regardless of output level

**4. Industry Technology Assumption**
- Industries use same technology for all products
- Production function = weighted average of inputs for primary + by-products

**5. Static Model**
- No price changes built in
- Relationships don't change unless different data year selected
- Underlying data unaffected by impact runs

- Vendor and contractor economic activity
- Secondary employment from county procurement

**Induced Effect (Employee Spending):**
- County employee household spending in local economy
- Contractor employee spending impacts
- Tertiary economic activity from wage circulation

### 3. BFS Economic Multiplier Development

**Budget Output Multiplier:**
- Total economic activity generated per $1 of county budget spending
- Formula: (Direct + Indirect + Induced Budget Effects) / Direct Budget Spending

**Employment Multiplier:**
- Total jobs supported per county position
- Includes direct county jobs + supply chain jobs + induced employment

**Tax Revenue Multiplier:**
- Additional tax revenue generated per $1 of budget spending
- Captures income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes from economic activity
